# Go Interpreter

An tree walking interpreter written in Go. The interpreter is used for a made up language just used for the purposes of learning. 
The language is made up of these features:
- C-like syntax
- integers and booleans
- arithmetic expressions
- built-in functions
- first-class and higher-order functions
- closures
- a string data structure
- an array data structure
- a hash data structure

The interpreter was built by following the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball but has been modified for my own purposes.
